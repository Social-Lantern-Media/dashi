# Dashi

A simple dashboard built using Meteor.js

----

## Getting Started


```
# Install Meteor
curl https://install.meteor.com | /bin/sh

# Start the App
meteor
```

### API Keys

Many dashboard panels rely on API keys to function. When working with the app locally, the easiest way to handle this is by adding a file called `api_keys.coffee` to `/server`, with contents similar to the following:

```
process.env.FORECAST_API_KEY = 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'
process.env.CTA_TRAIN_TRACKER_API_KEY = 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'
process.env.HELP_SCOUT_API_KEY = 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'
process.env.SEMAPHORE_AUTH_TOKEN = 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'
process.env.HEROKU_API_KEY = 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'
process.env.TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY = 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'
process.env.TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET = 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'
process.env.TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN = 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'
process.env.TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET = 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'
```

It's up to you to acquire and supply your own API keys for all services. `api_keys.coffee` should not be checked into version control for security reasons. In fact, it's added to `.gitignore` by default.

**Note:** Use of the Twitter Panel requires that you register an application at https://dev.twitter.com/
